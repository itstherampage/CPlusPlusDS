# C++ Data Structure Implementations

## Purpose

This repository serves the purpose of keeping a collection of C++ implementations for various data structures, providing a resource for (re)learning data structures in the context of C++ programming.

## Current Implementations

### Stack

The stack implementation in this repository includes functionalities such as push, pop, top, and isEmpty operations. It is designed to demonstrate the basic operations of a stack data structure in C++.

#### Usage

To use the implementations:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to test the stack operations.
